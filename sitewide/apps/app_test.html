                   Orbit is my 2nd full length album. Like <a href="../endofsorts/endofsorts.html">An End of Sorts</a> this album has come
                   together over a large period of time and with an overarching "story" behind it.
                   I think it should be obvious by now that I love space, the stars, and anything
                   like it that has that cosmic feel. Alongside that, I wanted this album's
                   cover art to reflect the new direction I decided to go with my music this time
                   around, mimicking an extremely old-video-game feel with low resolution graphics
                   and low-poly models<br><br>
                   The album is a progression throughout one whole orbit around some unknown star
                   startng in the early morning, and eventually leading into the dead of night.
                   There's a little substory somewhere in there that deals with the inhabitants of
                   this world, who seem to live a feudal lifestyle, and practice a religeon through
                   the sky.<br><br>
                   At the time of writing this, the LP has been in production for just about a year
                   counting some of the older songs on the current tracklist. Though that's not
                   saying much as the tracklist keeps chaning so much the album could span 3 years
                   or 2 months.
